This API aims to replace the existing implementation of Silk.NET.Maths.

# Current Status
- [x] Proposed
- [ ] Discussed with API Review Board (ARB)
- [ ] Approved
- [ ] Implemented

# Design Decisions
- This proposal should replace the 2.X implementation of `Silk.Net.Maths`, matching `System.Numerics` where possible, with concessions for design oversights in that api.
- This proposal assumes no knowledge of the 2.x Math library.
- Text herein marked **INFORMATIVE** does not form a normative part of this proposal, and is for background only.
- Within this proposal, the key words **must**, **required**, **shall**, **should**, **recommended**, **may**, **could**, and **optional** are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119 - Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). The additional key word **optionally** is an alternate form of **optional**, for use where grammatically appropriate. These key words are highlighted in the proposal for clarity.
- If any of the APIs contained herein are later deemed mathematically invalid in the context of their exposing primitive (e.g. a specific operation being inappropriate for a specific sized matrix), the Silk.NET team reserves the right to remove them at their own accord.
- Any static or extension method defined here must be provided in a non-generic class with the same name as the generic type it operates on.

# Vector Types

The main types defined for this proposal are the vector types, `VectorND<T>` where `N` defines the dimensionality of the vector between 2 and 4.

For each vector struct, the following requirements **must** fulfill the following requirements:
- Implements IEquatable with itself as the generic parameter
- Implements IReadonlyList with the components as the list elements
- Implements ISpanFormattable
- Implements ISpanParsable
- Implements IUtf8SpanFormattable
- Implements IUtf8SpanParsable
- Implements IParsable
- Implemetns IFormattable
- The relevant number of properties to represent the mathematical vector's components (X and Y for Vector2) and relevant unit vectors
- Constructors which take either a single parameter and uses it for every component, a parameter for each component, or a ReadOnlySpan of values which has the same number of elements as our vector has components.
- Constructors for 3 dimensions and up **must** include lower dimension variants that use the lower dimensions for their specific components (vector2 -> X,Y).
- A ref indexer that takes a int index and returns the corresponding component value (0 -> x, 1 -> y, etc.)
- An AsSpan function which returns this vector as a Span of the generic type
- A LengthSquared extension property which returns the dot product of the vector with itself.
- A Length extension property which returns the magnitued of the vector when the type `T` defines `IRootFunctions<T>`.
- A Dot static method which takes another vector and returns the dot product with our original vector. 
- For 3D Vectors, a Cross static method which takes another vector and returns the cross product with our original vector. 
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` operators defined between two vectors of the same type which returns a vector which has had each operation applied component-wise.
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` operators defined between a vector and a scalar value that matches the generic type which returns a vector which has had each operation applied component-wise with the scalar value. Both vector first and scalar first should be implemented.
- A `-` unary operator which returns the negated vector.
- A `+` unary operator which returns the vector.
- Overrides ToString to show component values.
- CopyTo functions which copy to an array or span, with or without a starting index
- Explicit cast and checked cast operators to all builtin type parameter variants of the vector types of the same dimensionality. (e.g. from `Vector2D<T>` to `Vector2D<float>`)
- Explicit cast and checked cast to and from matching System.Numerics vector type
- Explicit cast cast to lower dimensional matching vector with matching generic type
- Static Unit Vectors for each component
- A Static Zero Vector with zero for all components
- A Static One Vector with one for all components
- A static AllBitsSet Vector with all bits set for all components
- A deconstruct method for detupling
- An implicit conversion from a value tuple of the same size.
- Define static CreateChecked, CreateSaturating, and CreateTruncating which converts other vector types to this type
  - Try variants of these methods should also be defined which out the resulting vector and return a bool representing success or failure of the operation.
- Define Transform static methods which take a Matrix of higher dimensionality assuming 1 in for the final missing component and 0 for the rest (Vector 2 can use `Matrix2Xn`, `Matrix3Xn`, and `Matrix4Xn`) and return a vector containing the output (type should match the outer type e.g. `Vector2D.Transform(Matrix4X4)` returns `Vector2D`)
- Define `VectorND<T> * MatrixNXM` operators where N is the same for both Vector and Matrix, but M is any number
  - These operators should function like Transform, but without needed assumptions
- Define TransformNormal static methods which take a Matrix of higher dimensionality assuming 0 in for all missing components (Vector 2 can use `Matrix2Xn`, `Matrix3Xn`, and `Matrix4Xn`) and return a vector containing the output (type should match the outer type e.g. `Vector2D.Transform(Matrix4X4)` returns `Vector2D`)
- For types implementing IBinaryNumber<T>
    - `BitwiseAnd`, `BitwiseOr`, and `BitwiseXor` static methods defined between two vectors which returns a vector which has had these operators applied on a component-wise basis.
    - `BitwiseAnd`, `BitwiseOr`, and `BitwiseXor` static methods operators defined between a vectors and a scalar value that matches the generic type which returns a vector which has had these operators applied on a component-wise basis with the scalar.
    - `BitwiseNot` static method defined which negates the bits of the vector components. (BitwiseComplement?)
- A Normalize extension method which divides all components by the length of the vector, when `T` implements `IRootFunctions<T>`
- A Reflect static method which takes a normal vector and reflects the vector over the normal
- The following static Vector properties which have the given value for all components
  - PositiveInfinity
  - NegativeInfinity
  - NaN
  - Epsilon
  - NegativeZero
  - Pi
  - Tau
  - E

# Meeting Notes 

## 19/11/2023

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/live/yXNDZDE3AHE?feature=shared&t=9444)

- We agree with the addition to add scalar operations over vectors (i.e. Vector4\<T\> * T does X*T, Y*T, ...)
- Add an analyser for encouraging the most correct and most efficient type instead of using sub-optimal types. 
- Ensure we've documented that.
- Vector * Matrix?
    - assuming row major, not allowing matrix * vector (only vector * matrix)
    - does it make sense to just do it the way game engines do it and the way 2.0 does it?
    - possibly technically invalid mathematically, even if common programmatically.
    - easy to hit corner case that not all users may understand.
- Ensuring we have no upcasting and downcasting operators that could have unexpected behaviour.
- System.Numerics is strictly right hand, which is the same as XNA and somewhat default for OpenGL users. This differs with DirectX that is typically left hand.
    - Happy with having explicit LH and RH functions.
- Missing matrix APIs that were added in .NET 8 to System.Numerics
    - CreateLookTo (additional to CreateLookAt)
    - CreateViewport
    - CreateBillboardLH
    - CreateConstrainedBillboardLH
    - CreateBillboardRH
    - CreateConstrainedBillboardRH
- Investigate newer less-hated alternatives to quaternions for future (see Freya Holmer talks)
- Possibly have a general Transform struct in the future?
- Rectangles and boxes are obscured with regards to internal layout, bindings to have interchange types that implicitly cast to the mathematical constructs that are represented by the Box/Rectangle types.
- Investigate in the future if we can either add an Origin property for compatibility or an analyser for users to know that Min is the new Origin.
- Approved notwithstanding the missing APIs.

## 14/09/2025

[Video](https://youtu.be/s5MVZ3BMbac?t=327)

- It's weird having instance invocations (extension methods) and static methods.
    - Should we follow System.Numerics where possible?
    - Should we use this for things that would otherwise be an infix operator only?
    - We will remove instance extension methods and add them back later if we still want them.
    - We visited Length/LengthSquared as properties instead of .NET
- Approved notwithstanding instance extension method and Atan2(Memberwise, Scalar) removal
