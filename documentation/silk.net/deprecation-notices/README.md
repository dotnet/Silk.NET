# Deprecation Notices

As time goes on we may deprecate certain features or APIs within Silk.NET if it becomes clear they are suboptimal and/or
in need of replacement. We strive to post notices of such deprecations here, while also indicating a migration plan. If
a deprecation is made and a notice is not posted here, it is possible that the deprecation was for a niche feature/API
we didn't expect anyone to use anyway.

Below are a list of deprecation notices for each major version. Note that the lack of a deprecation notice does not
guarantee that there will be no incompatibilities between major versions - it should be taken for granted that you will
encounter breaking changes even if the API that has been broken was not deprecated in the prior major version.

## Silk.NET 1.X

- [SilkManager](SilkManager.md)
- [IVulkanView and related APIs](VulkanViews.md)

## Silk.NET 2.X

No deprecation notices have been posted for this major version.

## Silk.NET 3.X
