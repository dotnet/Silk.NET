MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

MICROSOFT PROJECT DIRECTSTORAGE
 
These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They 
apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such 
services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply 
prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft's rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU 
COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU 
ACCEPT THESE TERMS.

1.  INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
    a)  General. Subject to the terms of this agreement, you may install and use any number of copies of the 
        software on your devices, and solely for use on Windows. You may not use the software in a live 
        operating environment unless Microsoft permits you to do so under another agreement.
    b)  Included Microsoft Applications. The software may include other Microsoft applications. These 
        license terms apply to those included applications, if any, unless other license terms are provided with 
        the other Microsoft applications.
    c)  Microsoft Platforms. The software may include components from Microsoft Windows. These 
        components are governed by separate agreements and their own product support policies, as 
        described in the license terms found in the installation directory for that component or in the 
        "Licenses" folder accompanying the software.
    d)  Third Party Components. The software may include third party components with separate legal 
        notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) 
        accompanying the software.

2.  TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE.
    a)  Period. This agreement is effective on your acceptance and terminates on the earlier of (i) 30 days 
        following first availability of a commercial release of the software or (ii) upon termination by Microsoft. 
        Microsoft may extend this agreement in its discretion.
    b)  Access to data. You may not be able to access data used in the software when it stops running.

3.  DATA. 
    a)  Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and 
        send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our 
        products and services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the 
        product documentation.  There are also some features in the software that may enable you to collect 
        data from users of your applications. If you use these features to enable data collection in your 
        applications, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of 
        your applications. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and 
        the privacy statement at https://aka.ms/privacy. Your use of the software operates as your consent to 
        these practices.
    b)  Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal 
        data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union 
        General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 
        25, 2018, at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr.

4.  SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless 
    applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you will not (and have no right to):
    a)  work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways;
    b)  reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source 
        code for the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use 
        of certain open source components that may be included in the software;
    c)  remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;
    d)  disclose the results of any benchmark tests of the software to any third party without Microsoft's prior 
        written approval;
    e)  use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or
    f)  share, publish, distribute, or lease the software, provide the software as a stand-alone offering for 
        others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

5.  PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. The software is a pre-release version. It may not operate correctly. It may 
    be different from the commercially released version.

6.  FEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, 
    the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give 
    feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to 
    third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.

7.  EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and 
    regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. 
    For further information on export restrictions, visit https://aka.ms/exporting.

8.  SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for 
    the software. Any support provided is "as is", "with all faults", and without warranty of any kind. 

9.  UPDATES. The software may periodically check for updates, and download and install them for you. You 
    may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system 
    to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. 
    Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.

10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, 
    updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.

11. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the United 
    States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal 
    place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all 
    other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of 
    laws principles. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction 
    exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, 
    Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and 
    venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.

12. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You 
    may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state, province, or country. 
    Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the 
    party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the 
    laws of your state, province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the 
    software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions 
    apply to you:
    a)  Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this 
        agreement is intended to affect those rights.
    b)  Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the 
        automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to 
        the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling 
        the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your 
        specific device or software.
    c)  Germany and Austria.
        i.  Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft 
            materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in 
            relation to the licensed software.
        ii. Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the 
            Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable 
            according to the statutory law.
            Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in 
            breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance 
            of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the 
            compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases 
            of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK OF 
    USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. 
    TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED 
    WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND 
    NON-INFRINGEMENT.

14. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING 
    DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM 
    MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT 
    RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, 
    INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

    This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including 
    code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of 
    contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any 
    other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.
    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the 
    damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, 
    province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or 
    other damages.

15. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The software, including its user interface, features and 
    documentation, is confidential and proprietary to Microsoft and its suppliers.
    a)  Use. For five years after installation of the software or its commercial release, whichever is first, you 
        may not disclose confidential information to third parties. You may disclose confidential information 
        only to your employees and consultants who need to know the information. You must have written 
        agreements with them that protect the confidential information at least as much as this agreement.
    b)  Survival. Your duty to protect confidential information survives this agreement.
    c)  Exclusions. You may disclose confidential information in response to a judicial or governmental 
        order. You must first give written notice to Microsoft to allow it to seek a protective order or otherwise 
        protect the information. Confidential information does not include information that:
        i.  becomes publicly known through no wrongful act;
        ii. you received from a third party who did not breach confidentiality obligations to Microsoft or its 
            suppliers; or
        iii. you developed independently.
