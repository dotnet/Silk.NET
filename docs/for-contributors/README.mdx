# The Silk.NET Contributors Guide

Welcome to the Silk.NET project! We're so glad you want to help us create the best native interoperation experience that
.NET has ever seen.

This contributors guide covers many topics about Silk.NET's internals in great detail to help anyone pick up any part of
the codebase and hit the ground running.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, first clone Silk.NET using `git clone https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET --depth 1`. Your development
environment will need the latest production-ready .NET SDK, so make sure you've installed that from
[get.dot.net](https://get.dot.net). We also recommend installing NUKE using `dotnet tool install -g NUKE.GlobalTool` to
enable our auxiliary build commands/utilities, but this is optional and in fact can be accessed using the
`./build.sh`/`.\build.cmd`/`.\build.ps1` scripts in place of `nuke` in usages in this guide without installing the tool.

If you'd like to build and/or work with the mobile support in Silk.NET, you'll need to install the workloads using
`dotnet workload restore`. It is highly likely you need to prefix this with `sudo` on macOS and Linux. In addition,
you'll need to install the Android SDK with API 34 and API 35 support to ensure a successful build. Furthermore, on
macOS you will need Xcode installed with the iOS platform installed. Alternatively, if you don't want to work with our
mobile support, you can disable it for your local builds using `nuke disable-platforms --platforms android ios` for
example. The acceptable values for `--platforms` are any valid platform identifiers (i.e. right-hand side of the `-` of
a `TargetFramework`, without platform version information).

We automatically disable iOS support on Linux, as these workloads are only available on Windows and macOS. For more
information about the NUKE utilities, consult the [Build System](build-system.md) documentation or use `nuke --help`.

### Building from Source

Assuming you've got the prerequisites installed, `dotnet build`! Or `dotnet pack` to produce all the NuPkgs in
`artifacts/pkg`.

To learn more about the build system, see the [Build System](build-system.md) documentation. It is intentionally
designed to be as compatible as possible with the regular `dotnet build` system such that you can use the built-in
utilities of your favourite IDE.

### Regenerating Bindings

You can regenerate bindings using NUKE with `nuke regenerate-bindings`, but this isn't recommended. A full regeneration
of Silk.NET takes a long time and has the potential to touch the vast majority of the files that make up Silk.NET and/or
create loads of unrelated changes in your working tree. Instead, it is preferred to run SilkTouch manually using a
command like
`dotnet run --project sources/SilkTouch/SilkTouch/Silk.NET.SilkTouch.csproj -c Release -- generator.json -s Job1 -s Job2 ...`
where the values for the `-s` arguments are replaced with the job names (the keys of the `Jobs` dictionary in
`generator.json` e.g. `SDL`, `OpenGL`, etc).

For more information on SilkTouch arguments, consult the [SilkTouch User Guide](../silktouch) or use
`dotnet run --project sources/SilkTouch/SilkTouch/Silk.NET.SilkTouch.csproj -- --help`.
