## Test or Documentation Addition

These types of additions should just have a brief summary of what they are
doing. They do not need an attached issue. They should be prefixed with `[TEST]`
or `[DOCS]`.

## Bug Fix

Bug fixes should have a brief summary of the change as well as a link to the
issue they are resolving. They should be prefixed with `[BUG]` and should
include a regression test to ensure the bug is not introduced again in the
future.

## Proposal Implementation

Proposal implementations should also have a brief summary of the change and a
link to the proposal they are implementing. They should be prefixed with
`[IMPL]`. Ideally, they will also come with basic unit, functional, or
integration tests that validate they work as intended.
